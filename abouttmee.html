                <p>I grew up in a Spanish-speaking household, so when I attended school, I did not know how to write and read in English. Despite this challenge, I managed to create artwork as a form of expressing myself and even communicating. Math and English were my toughest subjects. I found art to be more to my liking. I did enjoy history classes because I enjoyed learning further about certain subjects I found interesting. When it came to creating an artwork, I would often research to get the details correct. From there, I got distracted and kept researching without realizing I had gone off topic. I took a Digital Media class in high school. I made enjoyable projects, such as making Valentine’s Day cards. I even used Adobe Illustrator to make stickers. Sadly, COVID was just starting, but rapidly growing, so that meant I couldn’t have access to the computers to create more projects. During quarantine, I started painting simple things like cartoon characters, and sometimes I painted landscapes. I often painted things I wanted to see in real life. When school started again, I took another Digital Media class and became more used to Adobe and how it works. I made more advanced projects. I created an underwater surreal room and added a whale because I am afraid of them. I created another project where I combined images of things I enjoy with a photo of myself. While I was enjoying working behind a computer. It often got exhausting staring at a screen and not getting to move around. When thinking about attending San Jose State University, I looked over what classes I would have to take. The classes were hands-on, drawing, photography, 3D art making, and still more options to choose from. I enjoyed learning that while taking Digital art classes, I would also take physical art classes. I love to be creative and have an open-minded attitude that allows me to come up with original ideas. Digital Media Art allows me to work freely.
